Here I name a few:

### Custom Stylesheets
User can set and edit stylesheet for each feed source. This can greatly improve the reading experience.

### Secondary Fetching
It support secondary fetching. For sites like Hacker News, the feed source doesn't supply any meaningful text content. Geek Reader will fetch it from the given link and merge it with the feed.

### Code highlighting
[Hightlight.js](http://highlightjs.org/) is used to highlight source code. Users can choose the color scheme for rendering.

### Shortcut keys

### Custom Feed Builder
(planned)
